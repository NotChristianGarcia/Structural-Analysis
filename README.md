### Structural Analysis
#### Description:
This is the final project for Structural Analysis.  
It is a MATLAB project that takes in input forces, elements, and nodes to a bridge. Resultant forces are calculated along with stress and deformation that are plotted and shown with varying colors on the bridge elements.
